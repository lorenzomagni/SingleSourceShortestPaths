This is my final project for the course "Programming Languages" that I attended at Universit√† degli Studi Milano Bicocca. It was a group project and I worked with two other people.

***DISCLAIMER:*** All the instructions and README files are written in Italian. The code on the other hand, is perfectly understandable by anyone.
